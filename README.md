After a lifetime of searching, I have found it. Me! You! we are one. 
What I do to for One, I do to for me, I do to for you, I do to for us. 
We are here to love and be loved. 
Keep open everything, our hearts our minds, our souls. 
To see to know what is coming, prepare what we can and get to and through the 3657 year event that will affect us greatly like this time and afterwards 
make only an open, service to others, society, of openness and love, 
make everything transparent so that success can celebrated, 
so that mistakes can be seen and know by all and corrected and not repeated. 
Help me, Help yourself, Help us, get ready and make it to through the event to the new time, new world.
